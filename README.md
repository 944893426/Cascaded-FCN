# Cascaded-FCN #
This repository contains the pre-trained models for a Cascaded-FCN that segments the liver and its lesions out of axial CT slices.

This work was published in MICCAI 2016 paper titled : 

```
Automatic Liver and Lesion Segmentation in CT Using Cascaded Fully Convolutional 
Neural Networks and 3D Conditional Random Fields
```

### Description ###
This work uses 2 cascaded UNETs, 

 1. In step1, a UNET segments the liver from an axial abdominal CT slice. The segmentation output is a binary mask with bright pixels denoting the segmented object. By segmenting all slices in a volume we obtain a 3D segmentation. 
 2. (Optional) We enhance the liver segmentation using 3D dense CRF (conditional random field). The resulting enhanced liver segmentation is then used further for step2.
 3. In step2 another UNET takes an enlarged liver slice and segments its lesions. 
 
The input to both networks is 572x572 generated by applying reflection mirroring at all 4 sides of a 388x388 slice. The boundary 92 pixels are reflecting, resulting in (92+388+92)x(92+388+92) = 572x572.

An illustration of the pipeline is shown below :
